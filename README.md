# Winder
Winder is a simple state machine based on Quartz Scheduler. 
It helps to write multiple steps tasks on Quartz Scheduler.  Winder derived from a state machine which is widly used in eBay Cloud.
eBay Platform As A Service(PaaS) uses it to deploy software to hundreds of thousands virtual machines. 
The state machine is also using for maintaining hundreds of thousands VMs and keeping them healthy.

# Why do you need Winder?

####Case 1:
Your job has multiple tasks that can be finished in couple seconds, so that you have to let something take care of it.
Winder can do it in background.

####Case 2:
You have bunch of items, each item needs to be processed in a couple of steps. Some of the steps can be guaranteed finishing in couple seconds.
Winder can help you define the steps and let them work automatically.

####Case 3:
You have some batch tasks, they should be executed every day. 
Winder can get this done easily.

# Plan
  Refine the code to use femto-coin to manage its components
 
# Production use cases

Production Use Cases: widely used in many distributed systems which eBay Cloud relies on.

**Software Deployment/PaaS**: As the key part of eBay Cloud, Platform As A Service(PaaS) is widely used in eBay. Developer uses it to roll out code. Winder takes the key role in PaaS.

**Virtual machine maintenance**: eBay has hundreds of thousands VMs. Keeping them healthy and available is very important. Winder makes this possible.

**Provisioning container or VM**: Provisioning requires lots of communications with other systems. It is also built on Winder.
